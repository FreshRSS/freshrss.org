It's not always simple to animate a project, especially to write articles to
keep the community aware of what's new. It's been more than 2 years since the
last article on the FreshRSS blog and we're not very proud of it. It is quite
ironic for a feed aggregator team to have an inactive feed, isn't it? (credit
to [Kevin Papst](https://github.com/kevinpapst) for this one!) We didn't sit
idly by for all that and we released 12 (twelve!) new versions of FreshRSS
since our last article, that's almost 6 per year.

After [few discussions](https://github.com/FreshRSS/freshrss.org/issues/38), we
have decided to redirect the website feed to the FreshRSS GitHub feed which
announce [new releases](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/releases). At
least, you should hear of us again!Â :) For the moment, we will not kill the
blog so articles will stay here.

The redirection will become effective **within the next week**.

Also, if you're interested in the project, please note our community is always
pleased to welcome new contributors. There is still [work to accomplish](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues)
and fresh ideas can help us to make FreshRSS a better aggregator.
