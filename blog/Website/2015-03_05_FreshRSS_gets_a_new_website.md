We have worked a lot to improve community processes since last weeks. Today we are opening a new section on the website: a blog!

You were a lot to ask for an official English thread associated to a RSS feed to follow us (that was the last straw for FreshRSS!). It is now available so don't forget to add [our feed](http://freshrss.org/feeds/all.atom.xml) in your favourite aggregator.

The paint is still wet but things should work smoothly since the blog is very basic.

Under the hood, there is a static website [powered by Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/). The initial theme has been ported to this great static website generator tool and improved a bit (e.g. the header navbar). It is already available on GitHub ([FreshRSS/Freshican](https://github.com/FreshRSS/Freshican)) such as the content ([FreshRSS/freshrss.org](https://github.com/FreshRSS/freshrss.org)).

As you may notice, there is no possibility to comment directly our articles: we want to avoid spam and moderation. Nevertheless you can meet us on GitHub, there will be a ticket associated to each article!

Since we want to adopt a “community-friendly” process, you will have the possibility to modify and/or write articles in order to be published here. If you want to contribute to this blog, please fork [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/FreshRSS/freshrss.org), create a new branch, write your article and send a pull request. The only condition will be that you must speak about RSS/Atom aggregation :).

To finish, stay in touch with us since there are still some great news to come in the next days!
