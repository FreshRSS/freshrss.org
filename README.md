# freshrss.org

Content files for [freshrss.org](http://freshrss.org) website.

freshrss.org uses [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) as static site generator. It is a powerful Python software which generates HTML from Markdown or reStructuredText formats.

This repository only contains raw content (in Markdown) and does not host FreshRSS theme.

Actually, there is one specific file: `./pages/index.html`. Yes, it is HTML (and not Markdown). It is the home page content of freshrss.org.

Blog posts are written in Markdown under the `./blog` directory.

## Installation

We assume in this section you have Python 2.7+ installed on your system, with `pip` command and you work in a virtual environment (`virtualenv`, `pew` or similar).

First, install Pelican and the freshrss.org dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install pelican Markdown
```

Then, run `pelican-quickstart` command:

```bash
$ mkdir freshrss.org
$ cd freshrss.org
$ pelican-quickstart
```

Pelican will ask you some information. Here are what is suggested but you can adapt to your own case:

- Creation path: current path is ok
- Website title: `FreshRSS, a free, self-hostable aggregator…`
- Website author: `Community`
- Default language: `en`
- URL prefix: `https://freshrss.org`
- Articles per page (consider pagination is enabled): `10`
- Generate Fabfile/Makefile: `yes`
- simpleHTTP script: `yes`

Finally, it will ask you which tools to use to upload your website: the choice is in your hands but SSH is recommended (it provides `scp` and `rsync` uploads).

We have now to adapt configuration from the `./pelicanconf.py` file:

1. First, remove `LINKS` and `SOCIAL` information, we don't need of them
2. Next, you should add the following lines to the file:

```python
SITESUBTITLE = 'A free, self-hostable aggregator… probably the best! <small>(in our opinion)</small>'

THEME = 'Freshican'

EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
    'extra/robots.txt': {'path': 'robots.txt'},
    'extra/favicon.ico': {'path': 'favicon.ico'},
    'extra/.htaccess': {'path': '.htaccess'},
}
STATIC_PATHS = (
    'blog/images/',
    'images/',
    'extra/',
)

ARTICLE_PATHS = ['blog']

INDEX_SAVE_AS = 'blog.html'

# To avoid conflicts between "community" author and category feeds.
# We don't use author feed anyway in the template.
AUTHOR_FEED_ATOM = None
AUTHOR_FEED_RSS = None

# Disable non-skined pages
TAGS_SAVE_AS = ''
TAG_SAVE_AS = ''
CATEGORIES_SAVE_AS = ''
ARCHIVES_SAVE_AS = ''
AUTHORS_SAVE_AS = ''

LOCALE = (
    'en_GB',
)

# Specific to FreshRSS theme
SITELOGO = '/images/freshrss_logo.png'

'''
SOFTWARE = 'FreshRSS'
TWITTER = 'https://twitter.com/FreshRSS'
```

We have nearly finished! All we need now is the FreshRSS theme (Freshican) and... the content (this repository!).

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:FreshRSS/Freshican.git
$ git clone git@github.com:FreshRSS/freshrss.org.git content
```

You should be able to start the development server and access the website (on http://localhost:8000) correctly:

```bash
$ ./develop_server.sh start
```
